# MTA Ridership Post-COVID Recovery Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This report analyzes the Usage Recovery patterns in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) ridership post-COVID. The main focus is on the largest three modes of transportation: subway, bus, and bridges & tunnels, which together make up over 92% of all transportation. The report delves into these recovery trends over time, comparing the recovery of different modes of transport. Additionally, it examines how recovery trends differ between weekdays and weekends.

## 2. Main Analysis
Across the MTA system, the recovery of ridership has been notably stronger on weekends compared to weekdays. However, trends differ per mode of transport.

### 2.1 Bridges and Tunnels
These modes have fully recovered, achieving 100% of pre-pandemic ridership on both weekdays and weekends. This resilience is primarily due to sustained commercial traffic, which has remained stable. These routes are largely utilized for freight and goods transport, which are less affected by changes in commuting behavior. The full recovery of Bridges and Tunnels highlights the critical nature of commercial transportation in the region.

### 2.2 Buses
Buses have shown the weakest recovery, with low ridership recovery on both weekdays and weekends. Economic challenges, particularly inflation, have had a disproportionate impact on lower-income riders, many of whom rely on buses for daily commuting. Financial constraints have led to reduced bus usage, reflecting broader economic stress that has hampered the recovery of this mode.

### 2.3 Subway
Subway ridership recovery presents a clear contrast between weekdays and weekends. On weekdays, recovery stands at approximately 73%, while on weekends, it has rebounded to around 84%. The lower weekday recovery is primarily due to the continued impact of remote and hybrid work arrangements, which have reduced the need for daily commuting. Weekends, in contrast, benefit from increased leisure travel, boosting ridership during non-work hours.

### 2.4 Notable Smaller Modes of Transport
#### LIRR
LIRR has shown a notable divergence between weekday and weekend recovery. Weekend ridership has surpassed pre-pandemic levels, reaching over 100%, aided by the opening of the Grand Central Madison station in January 2023. The expansion has enhanced weekend capacity, making travel to Manhattan more accessible for tourists and leisure travelers. However, weekday recovery has been more moderate, as the new station has had a less pronounced effect on regular commuters.

#### Access-A-Ride
Access-A-Ride has seen significant changes with its expansion into e-hail options. This has allowed for greater flexibility and convenience for individuals with mobility challenges, offering more options for on-demand rides. The e-hail feature, which partners with rideshare services, enhances access and ease of use, particularly in areas less served by traditional public transportation. The expansion of this service is important for understanding how the MTA is adapting to the diverse needs of its ridership. Further analysis of its impact on accessibility and overall ridership recovery could be insightful, especially in light of the pandemic's long-term effects on mobility.

## 3. Factors Influencing Post-COVID Recovery
### 3.1 Remote Work
The most significant driver of slower weekday recovery has been the shift towards remote and hybrid work. The pandemic forced many workers to adopt remote work, a trend that has persisted post-pandemic for a significant portion of the workforce. This shift has led to a reduced need for daily commuting, particularly affecting subway ridership. As remote work becomes a fixture in modern work culture, weekday ridership remains well below pre-COVID levels.

### 3.2 Economic Factors and Bus Recovery
High inflation and financial uncertainty have disproportionately impacted lower-income individuals, many of whom rely on buses for commuting. The rise in costs has made bus services less affordable, which has limited ridership recovery. As a result, bus services have seen the weakest post-pandemic recovery among all modes, with both weekday and weekend ridership remaining low.

### 3.3 Bridges and Tunnels
Unlike other transport modes, Bridges and Tunnels have seen steady recovery due to the stable demand from commercial traffic. These routes primarily serve freight and goods transportation, which remained critical during and after the pandemic. As a result, this sector has seen no significant downturn in usage, allowing Bridges and Tunnels to fully recover.

## 4. Further Areas of Analysis
The ongoing disparity between weekday and weekend recovery presents an opportunity for deeper analysis. Understanding the balance between remote work's influence on weekday ridership and the rise in leisure travel on weekends could provide insights into the future of MTA services. It is also important to assess whether these trends vary across different regions or modes of transport.

### 4.1 Shifts in Traffic Types on Bridges and Tunnels
Further research into the types of traffic using Bridges and Tunnels would provide valuable insights. Specifically, how has the mix of commercial and commuter traffic shifted post-pandemic? This could help the MTA better understand the demand patterns and plan for future infrastructure investments.

### 4.2 Tourismâ€™s Impact on Recovery
Tourism likely plays an important role in the recovery of weekend ridership across various MTA modes. If data were available distinguishing between tourist and non-tourist riders, it could offer insights into how tourism influences overall usage recovery. If tourism has been slower to rebound compared to pre-COVID levels, this could help explain the continued drop in overall transport usage. Analyzing these trends would provide valuable context for future transportation planning, especially in terms of targeting service adjustments during peak leisure travel seasons.

## 5. Conclusion
The recovery of MTA ridership post-COVID has been uneven across different modes of transport. While Bridges and Tunnels have fully recovered due to stable commercial traffic, the subway and buses have lagged behind, largely due to the continued impact of remote work and economic constraints. LIRR, with the addition of the Grand Central Madison station, has seen a remarkable recovery on weekends, aided by increased leisure and tourist traffic.

As the MTA continues its recovery, understanding the underlying factors driving these trends will be essential for shaping future transportation planning. Continued focus on the dynamics between remote work, tourism, and economic factors will be critical in ensuring the MTA's ability to adapt to the evolving post-pandemic landscape.
